        HAVING YOUR PERSONAL DATA ACCORDING TO GDPR
      </H1>
      <P color="#000">
        Support Group Network-SGN Sweden’s Privacy Policy – How We Process Your
        Personal Data. Support Group Network-SGN is keen that you feel confident
        in all your dealings with us. We comply with GDPR, the new data
        protection regulation, which means that we respect your privacy and your
        right to control your personal data. Our guiding principles are simple.
        We are transparent about which data we collect and why. We protect your
        data in the best possible way. Our privacy policy describes which data
        we collect, why we collect it, how you can have control over your data
        and how you can contact us. The policy applies in all contexts: when you
        visit our website, use any of its services, visit us on social media or
        get in touch with us in other ways, for example via email or an app. The
        policy also applies to data we receive via phone or regular post, or
        data you provide to us in any other way. Our privacy policy applies
        whether you are in contact with us as a donor, member, volunteer or
        someone just interested in our activities. It also applies when you come
        in contact with us in your professional role or as an employee. Support
        Group Network-SGN is the data controller in the manner described below,
        and we are responsible for processing this data in compliance with
        applicable law. This is highly relevant to you as a member or
        stakeholder. You can always contact us at Support Group Network-SGN at
        the address on the last page of this policy, regardless of where in the
        organisation your data is processed.
      </P>
      <H2 color="#000">The personal data we collect </H2>
      <P color="#000">
        Support Group Network-SGN primarily collects personal data directly from
        you. Examples of personal data we collect include your name and your
        contact information, such as phone number, email address, LMA number for
        asylum seekers or physical address. Account number and personal identity
        number are other examples. Support Group Network-SGN may use your
        personal identity number to update your data from other public
        registers, such as SPAR (the national register of personal addresses),
        if it is necessary to maintain good record maintenance (that is, when it
        is important for identification purposes to ensure that no one else
        receives your mailings and that we have the correct address). We may
        also use your mobile phone number to obtain your name or otherwise
        supplement your data. Sometimes we obtain your data from other sources,
        and in such cases we will inform you where we have obtained the data
        from. We do this during our first contact with you.
        <br /> <br /> Support Group Network-SGN will record personal data in
        connection with these events:
        <br /> <br />
        a) When you register as a member. b) When you register as a donor. c)
        When you sign up for or order a service offered through our various
        channels. d) When you fill in your email address or mobile phone number

        you are a candidate or elected official in one of our associations. l)

        Relationship between the National Association and the local associations
      </H2>
      <P color="#000">
        We are one Support Group Network-SGN, but there is a division of
        responsibilities between our National Association (SGN) and our local
        Support Groups associations. You can always contact us at Support Group
        Network-SGN at the address on the last page of this policy, regardless
        of where in the organization your data is processed. You can also refer
        directly to the relevant local Support Group. The National
        Association(SGN) manages the central member and donor register. Each
        local Support Group has access only to the member register that contains
        its own members. The National Association(SGN) provides all local
        Support Groups with technical and organizational solutions, such as for
        email and document management. It also provides policies and procedures
        relating to their practical application. Each local Support Group is
        independently responsible, and therefore acts as data controller, for
        the personal data that is processed in its own Local Support Group.
        Information is transmitted between the National Association(SGN), local
        Support Groups, and vice versa.
      </P>
      <H2 color="#000">Legal basis, storage and erasure of personal data </H2>
      <P color="#000">
        When you provide personal data to us, you are giving your permission to
        Support Group Network-SGN to record and store information about why you
        provided it (for example, to become a member or donor, or to order
        materials) and to process the provided personal data for specified
        purposes. There should be a legal basis for all processing. In this
        respect, we use the following: <br />
        1) Fulfillment of contract– For example, the actual requirements for
        becoming a donor or member or for making a purchase. 2) Legal obligation
        – For example, we are required to provide your data to the Swedish Tax
        Agency or to manage our own accounts. 3) Legitimate interest – When it
        is considered acceptable to use your data in our mission to help
        immigrants to integrate in the society in the easiest way and when our
        interests can therefore be considered to outweigh your interests. 4)
        Consent – When you explicitly state that we may process your data and
        that you understand what that means. This is how our objectives are
        linked to each legal basis: <br />
        1) Donor and member services - Fulfillment of contract and legitimate
        interest 2) Marketing and communication - Legitimate interest of
        information 3) Administration - Legitimate interest, legal obligation,
        fulfillment of contract and consent 4) Our care operations - Consent,
        legal obligation, legitimate interest 5) Notifications of concern -
        Performing a task in the public interest If we use legitimate interest
        as a basis, it will only be for the purposes indicated above. Note that
        you may, at any time, withdraw your given consent by contacting us. See
        “How to contact us” below. <br />
        Data processing is carried out in accordance with current legislation,
        and personal data is therefore not retained for the purposes of
        processing for longer than necessary. We have internal procedures in
        place to ensure this. Support Group Network-SGN will store your personal
        data for as long as you have a relationship with us, for example if you
        are a member or donor, and for some time thereafter depending on the
        purpose. Information that is older than three years will not be used for
        marketing purposes. This means that the data is erased when it is no
        longer relevant or necessary for the analysis or direct marketing
        purposes for which it was collected. Some information may be retained
        longer if required by other legislation, such as the Swedish Bookkeeping
        Act. However, when we process personal data we always do so with high
        security and confidentiality.
      </P>
      <H2 color="#000">Your rights and choices </H2>
      <P color="#000">
        You have rights regarding your personal data and you can influence which
        information is stored. Support Group Network-SGN will on its own
        initiative or at your request correct information that is discovered to
        be incorrect. You can at any time request that your information be
        deleted or that its use be limited by contacting us (see “How to contact
        us” below). If you believe that your rights are not being respected by
        us, feel free to contact Support Group Network-SGN or the Swedish Data
        Protection Authority (www.datainspektionen.se ). <br />
        You can, at any time, opt out of receiving direct marketing
        communications from us. If you want to avoid direct marketing in a
        specific channel, contact us through our contact information below. If
        you want to opt out altogether, you can also send us an email. You also
        have the right to object to processing that relies on legitimate
        interest if you have grounds relating to your specific situation. If we
        can demonstrate a compelling legitimate reason, however, a new
        assessment can give us the right to continue to process your data. You
        can obtain information about which personal data is recorded by
        submitting a written or digital request for a register extract from
        Support Group Network-SGN. The information is normally free of charge.
        It is also possible to get a copy of the data, as long as it does not
        adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
